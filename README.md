# DSA with C++ 🚀

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey using C++**.  
It contains well-structured implementations of core DSA concepts along with clear explanations, comments, and time/space complexity analysis.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Practice problem-solving using C++
- Maintain consistency and documentation for long-term growth
- Create a portfolio-ready repository for internships and placements

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Arrays
  - Dutch National Flag (DNF) Algorithm
  - Pair Sum
  - Searching & Sorting basics
- Time & Space Complexity analysis
- Clean and readable C++ implementations

More topics will be added gradually as I progress:
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** VS Code
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 📜 Certifications

- Deloitte Virtual Internship Program (Certificate included)
